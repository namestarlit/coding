## Learn Web
I will use this directory to learn web development using JavaScript, HTML,  
and CSS. I am not worried about how long it will take for me to be able  
to put a front-end application out there on my own, but I know one thing  
for sure that. I don't want to be a software engineer who solves problems  
half way, i.e. creating the backend without the front-end or creating  
a front-end without a back-end. I want to get good enough to create  
a software myself from start to end. From the first back-end file to the  
last front-end file and deploying it :)
