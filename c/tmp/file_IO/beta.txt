hello there
how are you feeling?

I will now tell you a short story about my life.
I have been leading a a lonely life for too long now
like a lone wolf

Oooh, it's another day, isn't it?
Let me see what I can write today:
But honestly, I miss her
I think of her often these days,
but no, I have always thought about her.

I like this
I just don't like it that I can't go back
to the previous line yet
