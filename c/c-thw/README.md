Hey C, I am really sorry for leaving you all those months.
I am back now, and I promise never to leave again.
I assure you that I will never leave again because
without you I won't be able to create the web server
and the Operating System I have been dreaming of creating.
</pre>

You and I will be on this for so long from now on.  
The goal is 10 years of coding as a Software Engineer  
Not just someone who can write codes.
