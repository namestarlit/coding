examples:
# This test won't pass without the directive. because the actual output
# doesn't have two blank lines.
>>> print(list(range(20))) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
[0,  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]

# This allows the use of ellipsis (...) to match
# parts of the output with any output.
>>> print(list(range(20))) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
[0, 1, ..., 18, 19]

# Multiple directives on a single physical line
>>> print(list(range(20))) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
[0,  1, ...,  18,  19]

# Multiple directives used on a single example are combined
>>> print(list(range(20))) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
...                        # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
[0,  1, ..., 18,   19]

# You can use ... to extend doctest directives to the next line.
>>> print(list(range(5)) + list(range(10, 20)) + list(range(30, 40)))
... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
[0, ..., 4, 10, ..., 19, 30, ..., 39]
